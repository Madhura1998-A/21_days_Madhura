# 21_days_Madhura 
Hi! My name is Madhura Aravendekar. 
I have completed my BE from Ramroa Adik Instituted of Technology,Nerul in 10/2020.
Currently I'm learning Data Science.
I want to create my experties in the field of Data Science. 
The main resoan for taking up the challenge of DataZen_21DaysChallege is that I'll stay consistent while learning and get motivate by interacting others students. As well as staying updated with the things which are requried while learning Data Science. 
As I have a basic knowledge about the python programming but not having a good command on the language so I would like to take Begineer challeges as a Practice(revision) and  intermediate challenge for learning new things.
Beginner : I'll first learn python language and In  Intermediate : I'll learn the Machine Learning concepts .
